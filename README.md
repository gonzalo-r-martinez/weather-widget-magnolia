# Weather Widget Magnolia

A simple widget to show the weather on the pages created with the content manager Magnolias CMS.

## Features

The widget is ready to work with the Magnolia Community Edition bundle, for its use we will only have to include the component in one of the columns of the Column Layout component.

## Usage

First we will have to choose the location we want to show. To choose the location the WOEID system will be used, we can obtain the WOEID of the location on the following web page http://woeid.rosselliot.co.nz/.

Once chosen the location will show the name of the location, an icon with the weather, temperature and optionally show, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, time of sunrise and sunset, and the forecast of the next days.
